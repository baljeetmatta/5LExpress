                       Passenger name as per the passport and also  verify the details on the itinerary before accepting it.

                     <ul>
                       <li>E-ticket will be sent to your registered email  address within the next 24 hrs after the confirmation of the payment &amp;  booking. In a few cases, it may take up to 48 hours.</li>
                       <li>To avoid the surcharge, your card may be charged  in split transactions. However, the total amount will remain the same as  mentioned in booking confirmation. A split charge may show as  AirlineTicketsFare.</li>
                       <li>Ticket fares/taxes are subject to change until  issued. Prior to your form of payment being processed and accepted  successfully, if there is a change in the price of airfare or any other change,  you may be notified of this change and only upon such notification, you have  the right to either accept or decline this transaction. If you elect to decline  this transaction, you will not be charged.</li>
                       <li>All customers are advised to verify travel  documents (transit visa/entry visa) for the country through which they are  transiting and/or entering.</li>
                       <li>Reliable information regarding international  travel can be found at www.travel.state.gov and also with the consulate/embassy  of the country(s) you are visiting or transiting through. Airline Tickets Fare  will not be responsible if proper travel documents are not available and you are  denied entry or transit into a Country.</li>
                       <li>All flights should be confirmed with the airline  directly as they may have last-minute schedule changes. You must reconfirm at  least 24 hours prior to departure for domestic flights and 72 hours for flights  to Hawaii and international destinations.</li>
                       <li>Please note that your seats, meals, frequent  flyer and other special requests are requests only. All requests will be  forwarded to the airlines.</li>
                       <li>Please be advised that not all seat requests are  guaranteed. If you want to receive immediate confirmation on your seat or if  you have any special requirement such as “stretcher assistance” or  “wheelchair”, please contact the airline directly.</li>
                       <li>If your credit card declines at the time of  processing your transaction, we will make all efforts to notify you by email  within 72 hours. The transaction will not be processed if your credit card has  been declined. The fare and any other booking details are not guaranteed.</li>
                       <li>Airline Tickets Fare will not be responsible for  providing any compensation in case of the airline schedule change. We make  every attempt to notify the customer of any schedule changes. It is always best  to contact the airline to reconfirm your flights within 72 hours of departure.</li>
                       <li>For date change and cancellation please contact  us 72 hours before departure.

                     </ul>
                     <p><strong>The date change is subject to availability.</strong><br>
                       If your itinerary includes two  separate tickets operated by more than one airline, please read carefully each  such airline’s terms and conditions, which can be found on each such airline’s  website. Each such airline will have its own restrictions, rules and fees. If  one of these flights is affected by an airline change (e.g. cancellation or  rescheduling) that causes a Customer to make changes to the other flight, the  Customer may be responsible for any fees or ticket cost incurred for making  changes to the unaffected flight. Such airlines may charge their own fees for  changes, refunds, or if exchanges are requested. You are responsible for  complying with each airline’s terms and conditions, which may differ (for  example, check-in times and limits on baggage size/weight).</p>
